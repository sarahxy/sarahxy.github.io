                    I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a double major in Cognitive Science and Linguistics, and a minor in Computer Science. I am passionate about human-centered design.

                    In college, I swore I would never touch STEM-related subjects again, but challenged myself to take courses in Computer Science to adapt to new ways of problem-solving and thinking. As I continued to study, I realized I was curious about the intersection between humans and technology, as I found one of my own strengths was being naturally empathetic towards people, their emotions, and desires. As a result, I broadened my studies to pursue the more interdisciplinary field of Cognitive Science, in order to explore theories on how the mind works and to walk that balance between people and machines. I devote my time to learning about design through self-study, classes, clubs, or internships. I apply lessons I learn from these various opportunities and my own creative energies to better design for the user's needs.

                    <div class="mini-card--text">
                        Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes through disciplines like psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, neuroscience and anthropology.

                        I like using the story of the six blind men and the elephant to explain my major: the six blind men approach the mysterious elephant, touch different parts of the beast, and try to conceptualize what the elephant is like based on their encounters. Likewise, Cognitive Science tackles the challenge of understanding the mind by drawing upon other perspectives in order to better model the mind. (Currently, the mind still remain rather inscrutable to us because we are using our own minds to study and formulate ideas about what our mind is like!)

                <div class="text">
                    In my spare time, I love reading books of all genres (but especially fantasy and science fiction), expressing myself through music and dance, traveling, taking photos, writing, and serving in different ministries at my church. I also love drinking milk tea and I am always down for a good cup of sweet or spicy chai.

                        I believe good design involves finding creative solutions to bridge the experience of technology with natural human perception and cognition, and helping users engage with products in a more meaningful way.

                        I took classes and built projects in Data Structures, Computer Structures, Algorithms, AI, Database Systems, and User Interface Development. I especially enjoy front-end development, and was even an instructor for a Web Design class at UC Berkeley.

                        Borne out of an early love for good literature and creative writing, I believe good design communicates well both visually and verbally. Whether I'm editing a friend's college essay for fun or writing something more personal, I strive to identify and bring out the unique and authentic voice of the writer.

                        I learned that, in teaching others, understanding different perspectives helps me find creative ways to teach in a way that is easily absorbed by students.

                        Going to China throughout high school to teach English to students (who were anywhere between the ages of 10 to 20) was a life-changing experience that allowed me to practice empathy across continents and cultures. I carried this lesson with me through other similar experiences, such as teaching English in rural Taiwan and to visiting scholars from Japan and China, tutoring a middle school student through math, and explaining front-end coding to a mixed audience in UC Berkeley's Web Design Decal.
