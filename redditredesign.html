					Reddit is one of the most popular sites on the Internet, but it is infamous for its somewhat unaesthetic design. The redesign of the Reddit homepage was a Web Design Decal assignment given in Fall 2015 at UC Berkeley. Our team redesigned certain Reddit pages using HTML and CSS based on informal user research we conducted.

				<div class="title">User Research</div>
				<div class="text">
					Because I had just taken a design class at Berkeley over the summer, I did not immediately jump into the project like so many other groups, especially since I had never used Reddit before. Instead, I took the initiative and suggested to my team that we could set our design apart from that of other teams by conducting some informal user research. So each of us interviewed our friends (who were avid Reddit users) on what they liked and disliked about the site.
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					Our general findings from our very brief user research showed that our pool of interviewees (mainly friends) went on Reddit primarily to read. As a result, while they admitted the overall layout of the original site was unappealing, the users liked the fact that they could skim quickly through noteworthy titles of the day on the site in order to choose what they would read.
				</div>

				<div class="title">Redesign</div>
				<div class="text">
					In our design, we sought to simplify the Reddit layout as much as time permitted, make the overall aesthetic of the site more appealing, yet retain the text-friendly aspect of the site that so many users enjoyed.

					Our project was selected by the instructors as one of the best-designed websites in the decal among the other group projects.
